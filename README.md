## üöÄ Running the Project

**1. Clone the Repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
cd yourproject
```

**2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):**
```bash
# Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

**3. Install Dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**4. Configure Environment Variables:**
Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables (update values as needed):
```plaintext
# .env example
API_KEY=your_api_key
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
```

**5. Start the Backend:**
Run the backend application locally. For example, if using FastAPI with Uvicorn:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

If you‚Äôre using Flask, the command might look like:
```bash
flask run
```

Once started, the backend should be accessible at:
- **FastAPI:** `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- **Flask:** `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

**6. Run Database Migrations (If Needed):**
If your project uses a database and migrations:
```bash
alembic upgrade head
# Or any other database migration command your project uses
```

**7. Start the Frontend:**
If your project includes a frontend built with a framework like Next.js or React:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

After starting the frontend, you can access it at:
- **Next.js/React:** `http://localhost:3000`

**8. View and Test the Application:**
- **API Documentation (if using FastAPI):**  
  Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` for interactive API documentation.

- **Frontend UI:**  
  Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to use the application interface.

**9. Troubleshooting:**
- Ensure you have the correct versions of Python and Node.js installed.
- Verify that all environment variables are set and that the `.env` file is correctly loaded.
- Check for any errors in the console during backend and frontend startup.
